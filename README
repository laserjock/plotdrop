PlotDrop
========
A minimal GNOME frontend to GNUPlot.

PlotDrop is designed for quick and simple visualisation of 2D 
data series.  It is not intended to encompass anywhere near 
the full capabilities of GNUPlot.

PlotDrop is intended to be used in tandem with an external 
filesystem browser such as GNOME's nautilus or KDE's konqueror,
whereby data files may be added by dragging them from the 
browser to the file list.

Data files should be simple flat data of the kind preferred 
by GNUPlot, like 
 1.0 3.6
 2.0 5.2
 4.0 5.1

The series of a datafile to plot is set as an integer in the 
plot list.  To plot more than one series simply add a file 
more than once and set a different series number on each 
entry.

Error bar (+/- y) sizes may be specified in an extra column directly 
after every data column.

Compilation
===========

PlotDrop is tested with GCC 3.3.  It requires the following 
libraries:
  * GTK+ 2.4 (earlier versions untested)
  * libgnomevfs
  * libglade

Just type "make".

Installation
============

PlotDrop may be run uninstalled from the directory in which 
it was compiled.  Alternatively, it may be installed systemwide 
by issuing the command "make install" with root privileges as 
appropriate.
